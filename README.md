# MINI-and-DOUBLE
This repository contains the code used to obtain some of the results in our paper "On the Security of LOL-MINI and LOL-DOUBLE against Correlation Attacks".

In MINI
- `1 MINI (search for active sboxes)` contains the model of  searching the linear approximation trails by their active sbox (.py)
- `2 MINI (search for correlation)` contains the model of  searching the linear approximation trails by their correlation (.py) and the verification program 
- `3 MINI proof of theorem 3 (1)(2)`  contains the proof of theorem 3 (1)(2)
- `4 MINI sum up`  contains the program of evaluating the accurate correlation for the linear approximation trail
- `5 MINI (multiple linear approximations)`  contains the program of constructing multiple linear approximations from b1,b2 and the summation program
- `6 MINI calculate the complexity of the correlatipn attack`  contains the program of calculating the complexity of this correlatipn attack

In DOUBLE
- `1 DOUBLE (search for active sboxes)` contains the model of  searching the linear approximation trails by their active sbox (.py)
- `2 DOUBLE (search for correlation)` contains the model of  searching the linear approximation trails by their correlation (.py) and the verification program 
- `3 DOUBLE sum up`  contains the program of evaluating the accurate correlation for the linear approximation trail
